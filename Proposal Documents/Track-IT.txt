Description:

	Health based application, focused toward Diabetics. 
	Application will have a very minimalistic interface,
	where the users will be able to enter:
	
		=>Blood Sugar Levels via text
		=>Blood Pressure Levels via text
		=>Weight via text
		=>Heart Rate via iPhone LED feature

	The users will also have an interface to make short
	journal entries.

	The application will utilize the SQLite database,
	with in the iOS device, and create a local instance
	for the user. Then synchronize with health.pinaksaha.me (API server)
	database, when there is internet access available.

	The application will be able to take the Journal
	entries and analyze the text via AlchemyAPI.

	The application will also generate monthly reports
	based on users input.
	
	Similar apps such as Diabetes Pal App and Glooko provide a way for diabetics to keep track of their measurements, but
	our solution is very simple such that any audience can use it. For example, the user interface will be much simpler.
